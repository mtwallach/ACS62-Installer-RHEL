This installer is meant to provide a quick method of deployment for the Alfresco Service team.

It is not to be used in a production environment or given out to customers. (at this time)

The files needed are as follows:

installer.sh
installers
	|
	|->alfresco-content-services-distribution-6.2.0.zip
	|-> alfresco-search-services-1.4.0.zip
	|-> apache-activemq-5.15.8-bin.tar.gz
	|-> apache-tomcat-8.5.43.tar.gz
	|-> openjdk-11.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
	|-> alfresco-global.properties.standard (customized file)

Assumptions:

1. That you will have a working and ready BLANK DB and that you will edit the parts of alfresco-global.properties.standard and installer.sh to accomodate the db.
2. That the system will be linux RHEL7 based.
3. This sets up a non-SSL version of Alfresco.

ToDos:

1. The user needs to be able to interact even to just change names or directories without having to edit the code.
2. The user should be able to see progress without having to tail the log script in another terminal.
3. The user should be able to select which DB they want to use and the settings automatically need to be edited.
